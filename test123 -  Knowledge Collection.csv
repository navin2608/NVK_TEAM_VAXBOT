They are all meant to teach the body’s immune system to safely recognize and block the coronavirus. The vaccine types include:
Inactivated or weakened virus vaccines, which use a form of the virus that has been inactivated or weakened so it doesn’t cause disease, but still creates an immune response. For example: COVAXIN
Viral vector vaccines, which use an altered virus to carry the genetic code (such as DNA) and create a protein that prompts an immune response, without causing COVID-19. For example: COVISHIELD
mRNA vaccines, which contain “messenger RNA” to make a coronavirus spike protein. This protein alone cannot cause COVID-19.Our cells use this mRNA to make the viral protein that causes our immune systems to make antibodies that fight COVID-19. For example: PFIZER",,,true,

That means it’s possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection.",,,true,
"",f938f1df-b6ed-5336-86e5-261b758502e7,"test123|| || ","What if I get COVID-19 in between 2 vaccine doses?","","","For most people who have 1 dose of the vaccine, the disease is likely to be mild or moderate, depending on how many days after vaccination the virus exposure happens. If exposure occurs within 1 to 3 weeks of getting the first dose (of Covaxin or Covishield), the vaccine is unlikely to have an effect and is not expected to change the course of the infection. However, if a person tests positive after 3 weeks from their first dose, they are highly likely to only get a mild case of COVID-19.
Once a person gets COVID-19, their body starts producing antibodies to it. Therefore, experts suggest waiting 3 months after recovering from COVID-19 before getting the second dose. Getting the second dose is important to ensure an effective immune response against COVID-19 in the future.
So, while experts learn more and as people get vaccinated, it is important for everyone (vaccinated and unvaccinated) to continue wearing masks, washing our hands, and keeping physical distance from others to help stop this pandemic.For more information, please visit: [https://www.mohfw.gov.in/covid_vaccination/vaccination/faqs.html](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/covid_vaccination/vaccination/faqs.html)",,,true,

Therefore, vaccines continue to reduce a person’s risk of contracting the virus that cause COVID-19, including the Delta variant. Vaccines are highly effective against severe illness, but the Delta variant causes more infections and spreads faster than earlier forms of the virus that causes COVID-19.Top Things You Need to Know:
Variants are expected. The best way to slow the emergence of new variants is to reduce the spread of infection by taking measures to protect yourself including getting a COVID-19 vaccine when available.
Vaccines keep you from getting sick, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19.
All COVID-19 tests can detect all variants, but they will not tell you which variant you have.

Help provide immunity (protection) against a specific disease
Help keep the vaccine safe and long lasting
Be used during the production of the vaccine
Ingredients provide immunity-Vaccines include ingredients to help your immune system respond and build immunity to a specific disease. For example:
Antigens are very small amounts of weak or dead germs that can cause diseases. They help your immune system learn how to fight off infections faster and more effectively. The flu virus is an example of an antigen.
Adjuvants, which are in some vaccines, are substances that help your immune system respond more strongly to a vaccine. This increases your immunity against the disease. Aluminum is an example of an adjuvant.
Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), in some new COVID-19 vaccines, is the active component that generates an immune response in the recipient.
Ingredients keep vaccines safe and long lasting-Some ingredients help make sure a vaccine continues to work like it’s supposed to and that it stays free of outside germs and bacteria. For example:
Preservatives protect the vaccine from outside bacteria or fungus. Today, preservatives are usually only used in vials (containers) of vaccines that have more than 1 dose. That’s because every time an individual dose is taken from the vial, it’s possible for harmful germs to get inside. Most vaccines are also available in single-dose vials and do not have preservatives in them.
Stabilizers, like sugar or gelatin, help the active ingredients in vaccines continue to work while the vaccine is made, stored, and moved. Stabilizers keep the active ingredients in vaccines from changing because of something like a shift in temperature where the vaccine is being stored.
Ingredients used during the production of vaccines-Some ingredients that are needed to produce the vaccine are no longer needed for the vaccine to work in a person. These ingredients are taken out after production so only tiny amounts are left in the final product. The very small amounts of these ingredients that remain in the final product aren’t harmful. Examples of ingredients used in some vaccines include:
Cell culture (growth) material, to help grow the vaccine antigens.
Inactivating (germ-killing) ingredients, like formaldehyde, to weaken or kill viruses, bacteria, or toxins in the vaccine.
Antibiotics, like neomycin, to help keep outside germs and bacteria from growing in the vaccine.
The claim that these vaccines contain a microchip or tracker is FALSE. The claim that these vaccines contain mercury is also FALSE.Composition of Covishield includes inactivated adenovirus with segments of Coronavirus, Aluminium Hydroxide Gel, L-Histidine, L-Histidine Hydrochloride Monohydrate, Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate, Polysorbate 80, Ethanol, Sucrose, Sodium Chloride, and Disodium Edetate Dihydrate (EDTA).Composition of Covaxin includes inactivated Coronavirus, Aluminum Hydroxide Gel, TLR 7/8 Agonist, 2-Phenoxyethanol and Phosphate Buffered Saline [NKA1].For more information about the ingredients and possible allergens, please ask your provider before getting the vaccine.",,,true,

However, a small number of vaccinated people may still get COVID-19, but it is likely to be less severe. That is why it is still necessary to wear a mask, wash hands, and stay away from crowds.Why a vaccinated person might get COVID-19:
It’s possible a person could have been infected just before or just after vaccination. It typically takes about 2 weeks for the body to build protection after the second dose of vaccination. Thus, a person can get sick if the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is evolving, and new variants of the virus are spreading. Current data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines offer protection against most variants. However, some variants might cause illness in some people after they are fully vaccinated.
A small percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus that causes it. These are called “vaccine breakthrough cases.” This means that while people who have been vaccinated are much less likely to get sick, it may still happen. Experts continue to study how common these cases are.
The overall risk of hospitalization and death among fully vaccinated people will be much lower than among unvaccinated people with similar risk factors.Source: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html)",,,true,

Good ventilation, along with other preventive actions, like staying 6 feet (2 meters) apart and wearing masks, can help keep you from getting and spreading COVID-19.Ways you can improve ventilation in your home:
Bring as much fresh air into your home as possible. 
Bringing fresh outdoor air into your home helps keep virus particles from gathering inside. Better ventilation means lower chances for transmission.

If it’s safe to do so, open doors and windows as much as you can to bring in fresh outdoor air. While it’s better to open them wide, even having a window cracked open a little can help.
If you can, open multiple doors and windows to allow more fresh air to move inside.
Do not open windows and doors if doing so is unsafe for you or others (for example, if there are young children, pets, a risk of falling, high levels of outdoor pollution, or if it could trigger asthma symptoms).



Filter the air in your home.

If opening windows or doors is unsafe, think about other ways to reduce virus particles in the air, like using air cleaners and bathroom or stove exhaust fans (see the next 2 points below).
Learn how to make an air cleaner using a portable fan and cardboard.



Turn on the exhaust fan in your bathroom and kitchen.

Exhaust fans above your stove and in your bathroom that vent outdoors can help move air outside. You can turn a free-standing fan into an exhaust fan by turning it to face outdoors (to improve air flow outwards).
Although some stove exhaust fans don’t send air outside, they can still improve air flow and keep virus particles from being gathered in one place.
Keep the exhaust fan turned on over your stove and in your bathroom if you have visitors in your home. Keep the exhaust fans turned on for an hour after your visitors leave to help remove virus particles that might be in the air.


Use fans to improve air flow.

Place a fan as close as possible to an open window, facing outside. This helps get rid of virus particles in your home by blowing air outside. Even without an open window, fans can improve air flow.
Point fans away from people. Pointing fans toward people might cause contaminated air to flow directly at them.
Use ceiling fans to help improve air flow in the home whether or not windows are open.

Get the child mentally ready for a new routine: Point out the positive aspects of starting school. Reassure children that if any problems arise at school, parents will be there to help resolve them.
Be patient: Exercise patience and refrain from using punishment as transitioning once again from home to school may be challenging for the students.

Encourage children to extend Positive offerings: Children may be asked to draw and color cards for their friends, teachers, and also family members as preparation for school reopening thus setting a positive tone and hope.
Collect Motivational resources: Students can be asked to collate good audio(podcasts) songs developed for and during the Covid-19 that they find motivating for sharing with school mates
Ensure their emotional safety: Parents need to make children feel safe and wanted by giving them the feeling that they can share anything and everything with them as they prepare to go to school, as well as their concerns while they are in school.
Acknowledge their emotions: Stay calm especially when the children are anxious. Pay attention to their feelings and give them space to share their fears, if any. Ensure that there is adequate time for sitting together and talking freely at different times.
Encouragement: Parents also need to encourage and guide their children to plan their daily schedule for school, studies at home, play, sleep, activities to maintain good health and hygiene, etc.
Appreciate your child: Recognize and praise even small accomplishments and efforts made by children. This not only develops confidence and self-esteem but will lead to the formation of good habits and better performance in different tasks.
Set a good example: Before expecting children to be disciplined, empathetic, healthy, and hygienic, parents need to practice such things. Parents need to manage their stress by getting good sleep, exercise, healthy diet, connected with friends and family.
Acknowledge your feelings: Understanding and recognizing one’s own emotions is vital for one’s well-being. As a parent one can help himself/herself and their children to navigate each one of their emotions and responses.
Focus on the things that can be controlled: Focusing on things that are out of one’s control can make one feel drained, overwhelmed, and anxious. So, focus on what can be controlled.
Taking care of the self: Make sure to indulge in physical exercises like yoga. Have a healthy diet and take care of your body.

These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols (lighter particles that can float and stay in the air longer than droplets, up to three hours).Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 2 meters/6 feet. This is why people should keep at least 6 feet distance from others. A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. Wearing a properly fitting mask can help decrease this risk.The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings. In these cases, aerosols remain suspended in the air or travel farther than 2 meters/6 feet. When possible indoors, open windows and doors for proper ventilation.People may also become infected by touching surfaces where droplets containing the virus have landed and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Wash your hands with soap and water regularly, and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs, tabletops, switches, and mobile phones.Further research is ongoing to better understand the spread of the virus and which settings are most risky and why. Research is also underway to study virus variants that are emerging and why some spread more easily than others.For more information, please visit: [https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-COVID-19-how-is-it-transmitted ](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted)To gain an understanding of COVID-19 transmission in indoor environments, visit: [https://covid-19.forhealth.org/covid-19-transmission-calculator/](https://covid-19.forhealth.org/covid-19-transmission-calculator/)",,,true,

COVID-19 टीके COVID-19 रोग, विशेष रूप से गंभीर बीमारी और मृत्यु को रोकने में प्रभावी हैं। लेकिन हम अभी भी सीख रहे हैं कि कैसे COVID-19 के टीके लोगों को बीमारी फैलाने से बचाते हैं। इसके अलावा, हम अभी भी सीख रहे हैं कि टीके COVID-19 का कारण बनने वाले वायरस के प्रकारों के खिलाफ कितने प्रभावी हैं। शुरुआती आंकड़े बताते हैं कि टीके कुछ प्रकारों के खिलाफ काम कर सकते हैं लेकिन दूसरों के खिलाफ कम प्रभावी हो सकते हैं।
कम संख्या में लोग अभी भी संक्रमण विकसित कर सकते हैं, लेकिन यह कम गंभीर होने की संभावना है। और इसलिए मास्क पहनना, हाथ धोना और भीड़ से दूर रहना जरूरी है। जब तक हम वेरिएंट के खिलाफ टीके की प्रभावशीलता के बारे में अधिक नहीं जानते, और जब तक कि अधिकांश आबादी को झुंड (या समुदाय) प्रतिरक्षा तक पहुंचने के लिए टीका नहीं लगाया जाता है, तब तक COVID-19 रोकथाम प्रोटोकॉल का पालन करना जारी रखना आवश्यक है।",,"अगर मुझे टीके की दो खुराकें मिली हैं तो क्या मुझे मास्क पहनने और दूसरों के साथ निकट संपर्क से बचने की ज़रूरत है?",true,
